It\'s designed with Single Tables in mind, but works just as well with multiple tables. It lets you define your Entities (with typings and aliases) and map them to your DynamoDB tables. You can then generate the API parameters to put, get, delete, update, query, scan, batchGet, and batchWrite data by passing in JavaScript objects. The DynamoDB Toolbox will map aliases, validate and coerce types, and even write complex UpdateExpressions for you. \ud83d\ude09","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"projection-expressions/index":{"id":"projection-expressions/index","title":"Projection Expressions","description":"DynamoDB supports Projection Expressions that allow you to selectively return attributes when using the get, query or scan operations.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"table/index":{"id":"table/index","title":"Table","description":"A Table represents a one-to-one mappings to your DynamoDB table.
